# Pre-Amplifier by Hippo

This DIY amplifier brings nice overtones to my guitar or my DIY synthesizer (link on github https://github.com/hipe-0/synthesizer).
3D-Print (link on Thingiverse https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6841592) and weld your own using the provided shematic and bill of materials!

This Guitar Amp is straightforward, it works and sounds great. Any feedback appreciated!

# Features
1. Based on the simple **LM386** amplifier IC integrated circuit
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a6b4c6d-d6de-4031-835d-a87ea6fb5e87)
3. **Volume** knob, **Gain** knob, **Saturation** switch, on/off switch
4. Nice amplification volume 
5. Nice ovetones on high gain
6. No preceptible audio noise or problem
7. **Distorsion** switch: simple clipping circuit using a single PNP transistor (S9012) ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/480d97f4-6392-442c-ab1c-eb6f65a24034)
8. On the oscilloscope, the upper part of the guitar signal is entirely chopped-off. A very drastic clipping stage! (side effect: it reduces volume quite a bit, but it's nice)
