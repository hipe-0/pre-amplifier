# Pre-Amplifier by Hippo

This simple amplifier brings nice overtones to my guitar or my synthesizer (link on github https://github.com/hipe-0/synthesizer).
3D-Print and weld your own using the provided shematic and bill of materials!

This is by no mean a highly polished guitar amp as I'm still learning, but it works for me and sounds awesome. Any feedback appreciated!

# Features
1. Based on the simple LM386 amplifier IC integrated circuit
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cefde06-c6d6-44b8-99a2-06de7cbee73a)
3. Volume knob, Gain knob, Saturation switch, on/off switch
4. Nice amplification volume 
5. Nice ovetones on high gain
6. No preceptible audio noise or problem
7. Saturation switch: simple PNP transistor based circuit. On the oscilloscope, I observe that the upper part of the guitar signal is entirely chopped-off. A very drastic clipping stage! (side effect: it reduces volume quite a bit, but it's nice)
